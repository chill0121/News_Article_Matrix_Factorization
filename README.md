# News_Article_Matrix_Factorization

Unsupervised topic modeling applied to BBC News articles.

The purpose of this project is to explore natural language processing techniques such as word token vectorization using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and utilizing unsupervised classification techniques such as Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Analysis of models will also delve into differences in supervised and unsupervised models on randomly sliced proportions of the training set.

This project derives from the Kaggle competition with the name BBC News Classification, found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learn-ai-bbc/overview
